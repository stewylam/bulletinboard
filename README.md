# bulletinboard

Bulletin Board Application Create a website that allows people to post messages to a page. A message consists of a title and a body. The site should have two pages:

The first page shows people a form where they can add a new message.
The second page shows each of the messages people have posted. Make sure there's a way to navigate the site so users can access each page.
Messages must be stored in a postgres database.
